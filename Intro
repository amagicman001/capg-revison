Hello, I’m Aman Deep from Muzaffarpur, Bihar. I’ve completed my Master’s in Computer Applications from [Your College Name], and recently finished my internship and training within Capgemini.

Over the past 6 months, I’ve worked extensively on core DevOps tools and workflows. I’ve created and managed Jenkins pipelines, integrated them with GitHub using webhooks for automated CI/CD, and built containerized applications using Docker and Docker Compose.

I’ve deployed and managed applications on Kubernetes, using Minikube and kubectl, and written YAML manifests for Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

I’ve also worked with AWS EC2, provisioning instances, managing security groups, SSH access, and IAM roles. On the automation side, I’ve written Ansible playbooks and Linux shell scripts for tasks like system monitoring, deployment automation, and file handling.

I’ve also utilized GitHub Copilot and AI-based developer tools to speed up scripting, enhance code quality, and accelerate YAML and configuration writing.

In addition to my technical skills, I value clear communication and collaborative teamwork, I’m reliable, a quick learner, and I approach my work with clarity and consistency, I also bring a problem-solving mindset, attention to detail, and the ability to adapt quickly in fast-paced, changing environments.


I believe my strong hands-on practice, solid understanding of DevOps pipelines, and readiness to take ownership make me fully prepared to contribute effectively to any live project.

Thank you for your time.
